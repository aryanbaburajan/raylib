# Raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.

I personally did not like the fact that raylib despite being a very popular library, did not have an in-depth documentation. So I decided to write and host it myself. [Here is the documentation](https://aryanbaburajan.github.io/raylib-docs/)

NOTE: I do NOT own the raylib trademark.
